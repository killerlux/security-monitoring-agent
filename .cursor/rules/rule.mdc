# Project: Security Monitoring → AppSec Bridge
# Goal: Itératif, petits changements, code testable, CI qui casse sur règles critiques.

- Always show a brief plan and impacted files before coding.
- Prefer small, reviewable diffs; avoid broad refactors unless requested.
- Use Python 3.11+, standard library first; justify any new dependency.
- Implement JSON Schema + example fixtures before collectors.
- Add unit tests for parsers/diff/policy evaluation.
- Generate human-readable run summary and rotate logs.
- Enforce Conventional Commits and provide run/test commands after changes.
- Never expose secrets, open ports, or run privileged actions by default.
