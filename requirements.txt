# Security Monitoring Agent - Requirements
# Python dependencies for the monitoring agent

# Core dependencies (should be available in Python 3.11+ standard library)
# Note: Most functionality uses standard library only

# Optional dependencies for enhanced functionality
PyYAML>=6.0          # For YAML configuration parsing
jsonschema>=4.0      # For JSON schema validation
pydantic>=2.0        # For data validation and serialization

# Development and testing dependencies
pytest>=7.0          # For unit testing
pytest-mock>=3.10    # For mocking in tests
pytest-cov>=4.0      # For test coverage

# Optional: For enhanced HTTP/TLS checking
requests>=2.28        # For HTTP requests (alternative to urllib)
urllib3>=1.26        # For enhanced HTTP handling

# Optional: For SBOM generation and CVE lookup
# (These would be used if implementing online CVE database lookup)
# requests>=2.28       # Already listed above
# defusedxml>=0.7     # For safe XML parsing if needed

# Optional: For DAST scanning (requires OWASP ZAP)
# These are not Python dependencies but system requirements:
# - OWASP ZAP (Java application)
# - curl (for ZAP API communication)

# System requirements (installed via package manager):
# - ss-utils (for network monitoring)
# - systemd (for service monitoring)
# - iproute2 (for network interface monitoring)
# - procps (for process monitoring)
# - curl (for HTTP requests)

# Note: This agent is designed to work with minimal dependencies
# and relies primarily on Python standard library and system tools.
# Optional dependencies are only needed for enhanced functionality.
